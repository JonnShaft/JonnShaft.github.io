My name is Ahmad and I a full stack developer from Denver, CO. I am an alumnus of The Firehose Project, an intense 15-week online full stack web development boot camp, where I built and launched fully functional web applications using real tools. 

During my time at The Firehose Project, I thought, worked, and tackled challenges like a professional software engineer by working on both ends of the stack. I built three web applications while in Firehose: a quotes generator app built on Ruby on Rails with a mobile first design; a Yelp clone app integrated with Google Map API focused on mobile first design; and a Udemy clone app, its UI includes JavaScript, jQuery, and Ajax. In addition to building web applications on my own, I worked as part of an agile team on an application build that mimicked real world experience. I am proficient in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Git, Sass, Amazon Web Services, and Bootstrap, among others.

Over the past 13 years I have worked in the legal industry as a trial paralegal, including working extensively with eDiscovery. I also have over 2 years of digital forensics experience including over 50 forensic analysis cases worked and hundreds of onsite and remote electronic data collections performed. I am a graduate of the University of Nevada, Las Vegas with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English.
